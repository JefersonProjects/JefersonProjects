- 👋 Hi, I’m @JefersonProjects
- 👀 I am interested in software development. I am passionate about solving complex problems and creating applications that have real impact.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning more about databases and how to integrate them with my Java applications. I'm also exploring web development and how I can use my Java skills in that field.
- 💞️ I am looking to collaborate on projects that challenge me and help me grow as a developer. I am particularly interested in web development projects.
- 📫 You can contact me through my email: jeffersonalejandro943@gmail.com. You can also follow me on GitHub to see my latest projects.
